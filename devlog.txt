Team PartyLand: Nalanda Sharadjaya and Pardeep Singh

1/11/16 (In-Class): Discussed/finalized outline for structure of Kumar. Superclass Sentence w/ subclasses different types of sentences. Kumar generates a Sentence in response to inputs read through cs1/Keyboard.java. If he can't figure out what you're saying, he'll make a random sentence in response.

1/13/16 (Pardeep): Initialized Kumar, taught it to construct basic sentences (no articles/grammar) with variety of noun/verb -phrases

1/14/16 (In-Class): Initialized Word structure, Kumar generates sentences with noun-phrases and verb-phrases (num. of adverbs and adjectives non-constant)

1/14/16 (Nala): Initialized pluralize() and conjugate() methods (must be expanded for greater functionality later on), updated Phrase structure, made flow chart and UML diagram
1/14/16 (Pardeep): Attempted to use the built in java html parser with dictionary.com(did not push to github becuase it wasn't successful)

1/15/16 (Nala): Initialized Sentence structure, created basic Question and FunFact types

1/16/16 (Nala): Updated NounPhrase to create first- and second-person sentences as well, created new Sentence type (Declarative)
1/16/16 (Pardeep): created Farewell and Greeting classes

1/17/16 (Nala): Initialized response mechanism via class Reader (will be used as long as Kumar is required to test new Sentence types) - can recognize sentences that end with "?" as questions

1/18/16 (Pardeep): Kumar can now separate questions based on 5W's and H. Returns different response for each. Questions can now either have a key question word or a "?"

1/19/16 (In-Class): Initialized Filler class, improved question response mechanism
1/19/16 (Nala): Created CSV Parser class, modified Phrase classes to parse String arrays via text files
1/19/16 (Pardeep): Kumar recognizes and responds to Farewells and Greetings and terminates after Farewells. NounPhrase now uses a HTMLParse that uses dictionary.com to find the plural version of some nouns that are not pluralized the normal way

1/20/16 (In-Class): Updated CSV Parser to work with ArrayLists as opposed to String arrays
1/20/16 (Nala): Generates semi-related responses if it can, by searching for individual words from an input in a larger list of nouns
1/20/16 (Pardeep): HTMLParser finds singular version of plural nouns(input might contain plural versions) Kumar understands plural nouns and rejects all inputs containing gibberish

1/21/16 (In-Class): Developed method to strip punctuation from individual inputted words, so Kumar can recognize more stuff.

1/22/16 (In-Class): Pushed work from day before. Debugging with verb conjugation. Initialized varied noun structure.

1/23/16 (Nala): Completed noun structure. Question response structure updated to reflect new noun structure (three types of questions: Who, What, Where)--Who responds to names, What responds to animals, colors and food, Where responds to locations. Debugging
1/23/16 (Pardeep): Debugging with isGreet() in Kumar, filename changes. Set up foundation for Question structure (Who/What/Where/When/Why/How) and misspelled word suggestion (unsure if this feature will be finished in time) worked on How,When,Why classes. general debugging throughout the files. Fixed Greeting.java to respond better
