Why do you say that?
Is that so?
How fascinating.
I often wonder if that's true.
Are you sure?
*grunts noncommittally*
I never thought of that.
Hmm...interesting.
That's unfortunate.
I find that hard to believe.
*rolls eyes*
That sounds interesting.
Cool!
Bo-ring.
If you say so.
Indeed.
I suppose.
You're right.
You're almost certainly wrong.
Well, if you put it like that.
Yeah.
Yep.
Mhm.
Quite right.
Certainly.
*sips tea*
Wonderful.
Unbelievable.
Fantastic.
Imagine that!
Who would have thought?
Do you really think so?
*yawns*
You're fantastic.
