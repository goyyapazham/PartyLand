Why do you say that?
Is that so?
How fascinating.
I often wonder if that's true.
Are you sure?
*grunts noncommittally*
I never thought of that.
Hmm...interesting.
That's unfortunate.
I find that hard to believe.
*rolls eyes*
That sounds interesting.
Cool!
Bo-ring.
If you say so.
Indeed.
I suppose.
You're right.
You're almost certainly wrong.
Well, if you put it like that.
Yeah.
Yep.
Mhm.
Quite right.
Certainly.
*sips tea*
Wonderful.
Unbelievable.
Fantastic.
Imagine that!
Who would have thought?
Do you really think so?
*yawns*
You're fantastic.
That's awesome!
Let me ask you this: do you, really?
that's interesting
You're right.
Let me ask you this: you're pretty smart, you know that?
Dunno.
Indeed.
Let me ask you this: you're supposed to be a robot, aren't you?
Yep.
Indeed.
Interesting.
That's cool.
Oh, I see.
That's good to hear.
Yes.
It is!
I do.
Interesting...
Oh, I see.
Yeah...
Nothing much.
Let me ask you this: is that so?
Oh, I see.
That's so funny.
Let me ask you this: was that a mistake?
I do!
Yeah, it is.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
Yes, it is.
Let me ask you this: isn't it?
We should ponder that for a moment.
Let me ask you this: don't you think?
Okay, I'll try.
That's cool.
Wonderful.
That's cool.
Funny you should ask.
Cool!
Yep.
Funny.

That's good to hear.
Awesome!
Yep.
