Is that so?
How fascinating.
I often wonder if that's true.
Are you sure?
*grunts noncommittally*
I never thought of that.
Hmm...interesting.
That's unfortunate.
I find that hard to believe.
*rolls eyes*
That sounds interesting.
Cool!
Bo-ring.
If you say so.
*sips tea*
Indeed.
I suppose.
You're right.
You're almost certainly wrong.
Well, if you put it like that.
